# TUNIZI-Dataset: Context and Topics
On social media, Arabic speakers tend to express themselves in their own local dialect. To do so,
Tunisians use "Tunisian Arabizi", which consists in supplementing numerals to the Latin script rather
than the Arabic alphabet. 
TUNIZI is the first Tunisian Arabizi Dataset including 3K sentences, balanced, covering different topics, preprocessed and annotated

# Collection Process
TUNIZI is collected from comments on Youtube social network videos.
All data was directly observable and did not require other data to be inferred from.
The latest comment existing in TUNIZI was published in 30/08/2019 and the most recent comment in 08/01/2020.
Comments were collected using scraping to extract our data from YouTube videos.
During the collection, any non arabizi comment is removed. 
We present a sample of size 3k out of a larger dataset containing 10k comments where 1500 positive comment and 1500 negative ones were taken randomly from the original dataset.
Data was collected by the iCompass team working on this project.

# Preprocessing and Annotation Process
TUNIZI was preprocessed by removing links, emoji symbols and punctuation.
Annotation was then performed by five Tunisian native speakers, three males and two females at a higher education level (Master/PhD). 
Comments are annotated as positive (1) or negative(-1)
